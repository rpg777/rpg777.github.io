## About 

A long time ago, Rob had a website and a blog. It got pretty good, but in the end it was merely full of the rantings of a daily NJ-to-NYC commuter. Facebook happened, Instagram, and the rest. It all fell by the wayside. Moves, both digital and physical, happened. Life and death happened. People came and went. 

Rob now lives in Tucson, AZ and is working his way back from an awful lot of shit. He is going to put written and photographic pieces of his life back up here, and the usual links to the other usual shit may be found in the footers and eventually elsewhere on this site. 

The old rumblestrip.org will again host the 9/11 eyewitness account and some other popular favorites, and the rest of what gets resurrected will probably surface on this site.
